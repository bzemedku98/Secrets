# Secrets

For this project, I created a website that pulls data from an API containing secrets and displays them on cards. 
The site will have them hidden behind cards and once the user hovers over the card, the secret will be displayed
on the screen. Below the card will be the username of the user.

In order to run this site, you must clone it on your machine using this command:\
```
git clone https://github.com/bzemedku98/Secrets.git
```

//Make sure to have node installed before proceeding further.
Then run npm install to install all the node and json packages. 
Once you've done that, you can run it by doing ```node index.js``` on your terminal.
